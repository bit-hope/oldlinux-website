<br>When study a work, its easy to begin with its early types or states. You can benefit from it and doubling your efficiency. This thought cames from the theory of Floyd. Every matter has got its idiosyncrasy formed at "childhood". From the processes of its development, you can understand its nature throughly.
<br><br>
<a href=download/linux-devel.pdf target=_blank>The Inception & Development of Linux</a> also obeys this role.
<p>I have search the infomation about the brewing & starting of Linux all the time on internet. From the first time Linus Toravlds brought his i386sx compatible PC to the release of Linux version 0.99 in 1993. I even simluate the starting periods Linus create Linux 0.01 on <a href=http://minix.net/ target=_blank>Minix-386</a> system and obtain some importent feeling about it asif I was with Linus when he programing the first kernel.
<p>
This ebook (now only in Chinese) was written just at these search period.

NOTE: The book has been published by the China Machine Press. If you feel that its not convenient to read the ebook, then I suggest you buy a paper version of it. The main difference between the ebook and the paper book is that in order to reduce the volume of the book, chapter 14 (experiments) is not included in the paper book. By the way, when reading the other kernel sources, this book can also be used as a reference.<br><br>

The book has also been published by the <a href=http://www.drmaster.com.tw/> Taiwan Drmaster culture Ltd.</a> company located at Taipei, Taiwan. Since I havn't got the chance to do the last correction just before the press, there may be some errors in the book. I'll provide the errata as soon as I get & read it. BTW, this book is based on Linux kernel version 0.12<br><br>

An enhanced book has also been published by the China Machine Press early this year (2006). Several new chapters describing the basic infomation of the kernel have been added, and almost all the source code comments have been rewritten to be more understandable. <br><br>
